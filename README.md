# Modify Mobs

### by Nuhser

**Requires [nuhser_core 4.0.0](https://github.com/Nuhser/nuhser_core "Nuhser_Core") to be installed first!**

With this mod, you can modify mobs by renaming them with a name tag, for example, to mute them. The following names are possible:

To mute a mob you can rename it to `!silent`. Naming it `!not silent` will unmute it again.

Naming it `!baby` will stop the mob from aging. This way it will stay a baby for ever. You can undo this by renaming it `!not baby`. But it takes the mob another 20 minutes to grow and become an adult.

Renaming a rabbit `!killer` turns any ordinary bunny into the legendary Killer Bunny. **This can't be undone!**
